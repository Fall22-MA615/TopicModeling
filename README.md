# Topic-Modeling
This is a group project on text analysis done by Bill, Danya, Jiun, and Priam.
We chose to do an analysis on IMDB dataset which includes 50K movie reviews for natural languarage processing.
This is a report we organized together to show the top words used in each genre of our Latent Dirichelet Allocation model.

Each of our team member has their own tasks. Please check the commit besides the file name to know who uploaded that file into this repository.

This assignment includes the following Processes:
1. Importing Data
2. Data Cleaning
3. Create Latent Dirichelet Allocation model
4. Create Graphs and Plots for the model
5. Gathering Document-topic probabilities information
6. Getting ##Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency
7. Creating tf-idf plots
8. Full analsis and explanation of the graphs

We used Rmarkdown files to create the report then knit our final html report.
Please check the Final_Topic_Modeling.pdf for our finalized report. Enjoy.
